## Project Overview

This project is a single page application using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. There are 5 people working on this at the same time, and the time scope is 3-5 days. The main goal of this is to practice effective collaboration skills, and apply best practices in web development.

The main theme of the project is to create an interactive piano interface that responds to user input and plays sounds. This is the main requirement for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Additional features, such as visuals using HTML Canvas, may be implemented based on time and team capacity.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Quality Standards:** Ensure semantic HTML, W3C/Jigsaw validation, accessibility compliance (ARIA, color contrast, alt text), and responsive design. These are important, and are part of the assessment criteria.
- The website must be responsive and work on different screen sizes. We will use a mobile-first approach.
- This project is designed to be an introductory project for developers who are new to JavaScript. Do not write overly complex code unless the user has explicitly requested it. If more complex code is required for a feature, add comments to explain the code and its purpose.

## Coding Style

- Prefer to use the Bootstrap framework for styling, unless stated otherwise.
- Keep any custom CSS logically organised. For example, more global selectors should be placed at the top of the file.
- Keep code changes small and focused, and think ahead to any potential merge conflicts, trying to prevent them if possible.

## Additional Tips

- Look through the git history, if you have access, to determine who worked on what. Use this to get a rough idea of who is the main contributor to certain sections of code.
- Feel free to suggest a suitable name for a commit message when a feature is added or changed. Use best practices for writing commit messages, and make sure they are consistent in style and are descriptive. Do NOT try to commit anything unless the user has explicitly requested it in the prompt.
